# Accountable Entities (AE) Conformance Predicate Surface (v1)

REQ:
  Provide a single, deterministic, identifier-aligned conformance surface for AE v1.

WHY:
  AE identifiers are the sole normative references across prose, schema, and proof.
  Lean conformance evidence must therefore be keyed to the canonical identifiers,
  not to human-friendly names that may change.

OBS:
  - The canonical AE kind constructors are `Kind.K1 .. Kind.K6`.
  - Human-readable kind names (Actor/Locus/...) are definitional abbreviations only,
    defined in `AccountableEntities/Spec/KindNames.lean`.
  - Canonical AE v1 kind identifiers are `AE.KIND.K1 .. AE.KIND.K6`.
  - This file does not assign domain semantics; it only provides structural shapes.

REQ.AE.CONFORMANCE.EVIDENCE:
  AE v1 requirements as stable propositions.

WHY:
  Fields are the Lean-level mirror of identifiers. This supports:
  - deterministic "exactly once" traceability, and
  - stable referencing from other Lean modules without relying on prose order.

OBS:
  Fields are alphabetized by canonical identifier name to reduce editorial discretion.

REQ.AE.CONFORMANCE.REQUIREMENTS_LIST:

WHY:
  Conformance is defined as conjunction over this list.
  The list must preserve the same canonical, alphabetical order used everywhere else.

OBS:
  Alphabetical order here is by identifier string, not by KindNames.

REQ.AE.CONFORMANCE.EXTRACTOR:

WHY:
  Conformance evidence is often consumed indirectly.
  This lemma provides a stable way to extract any required proposition from Conforms.

/-
REQ.AE.IDENTITY.REGIME.MAPPING.INJECTIVE:

WHY:
  AE requires distinct kinds to correspond to distinct identity regimes.
  This is one structurally checkable formulation of that requirement.
